<h1>How to create your first Swrtj file</h1>
	<p>
		The Swrtj plugin makes available a file wizard that creates a new swrtj file with an example included.<br/>
		After creating a new swrtj project (see <a href="firstJavaProject.html">How to create your first Swrtj project</a>), that we call 'MySwrtjProject', you can open 
		the file wizard from the 'file' menu choosing New > Other and then Swrtj/Swrtj file.</br>
		Click on the 'Next' button and then insert the container name(i.e. the folder in which you want to create the file) and the file name.
