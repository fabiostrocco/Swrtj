<h1>Code generation</h1>
	<p>
		The code generation involves the creation of the java files equivalent to the Swrtj ones.<br/>
		If you try to compile an swrtj file 'File.swrtj' in the 'src' folder, every element in the file will be translated to a java class or interface
		and it will be created within the 'src-gen' folder in the 'packages.file' package. Since the package name is taken from the file name please
		use just characters and/or letters in an swrtj file name if you want to generate it.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Every <em>program</em> element (see <a href="Programs.html">Programs</a>) is translated as a java executable file so that, if you right click on it and choose
		Run As > Java Application you can run it.
