<h1>Outline view</h1>
	<p>
		The <em>outline</em> is a view (located at the right of the editor) that shows your swrtj file. The structure shown is a tree where the root is the file that
		has interfaces, classes, records, traits, programs and imports as children.<br/>
		Here's an example.
	</p>
	
	<img src="Outline.png" align="center"/>
	<p>
		The red circle indicates a required field (like <em>stream</em> in <em>TSyncWriter2</em>), the green one indicates a provided field (like in classes).<br/>
		Trait <em>TSyncWriter2</em> contains the <em>unsyncWrite</em> method with the red icon and the <em>write</em> method with the blue icon because the
		first one is a request (i.e., the trait <em>TSyncWriter2</em> has not the implementation of this method) while the second one is a provided method.
